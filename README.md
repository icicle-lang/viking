# Viking

The Vikings were daring masters of the sea. The shallow draught of their
swift wooden longships meant that they were able to reach far inland by
river and stream, striking and moving on before local forces could
muster.

## Overview

Viking is an opinionated wrapper around 
[michaelt](https://github.com/michaelt)'s
[streaming](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/streaming) and
[streaming-bytestring](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/streaming-bytestring)
libraries. The motivation is twofold, to rename some problematic data
types and modules so that usage is a bit more seamless, and to provide
additional functionality on top in an `x-` like fashion. In particular,
functions which throw exceptions are replaced with ones which expose
errors in `EitherT`.

## Alternatives

Viking, and indeed the `streaming` library, differs from libraries like
`conduit` and `pipes` in that it models streams as lists rather than
list transformers.

Using the analogy of pure lists, you can think of a `Conduit a m b` as
a function from `[a] -> [b]`, a `Source m a` can be thought of as
a `[a]` and a `Sink m b` can be thought of as a `[b] -> ()`. In Viking
on the other hand, a `Stream (Of a) m ()` is equivalent to a `[a]`, and
everything else is just functions. The implication of this is that
writing streaming operations with Viking feels a lot like programming
with lists.

For example, if you wanted to write a function which adds one to an
integer stream and then turns it into a string:

#### Data.List

```hs
transform :: [Int] -> [String]
transform =
  fmap show . fmap (+ 1)
```

#### Viking

```hs
transform :: Monad m => Stream (Of Int) m r -> Stream (Of String) m r
transform =
  Stream.map show . Stream.map (+ 1)
```

#### Conduit

```hs
transform :: Monad m => Conduit Int m String
transform =
  Conduit.map (+ 1) =$= Conduit.map show
```
